\begin{quote}
\textbf{``Love is the state in which man sees things most widely
different from what they are. The force of illusion reaches its zenith
here, as likewise the sweetening and transfiguring power. When a man is
in love he endures more than at other times; he submits to
everything.''} (Nietzsche,

\begin{quote}
The concluding track to The Slow Rush, ``One More Hour'' features Kevin
thinking back on all that has led him to where he is, and what he has to
look forward to in life. It touches on the records main theme of the
passage of time, and what finding love has meant for his future. It
starts with minimal piano, and slowly builds on itself with anthemic
guitar riffs, hard hitting drums, laid back vocals and a woozy mix.

\subsubsection{Tame Impala · 2020 Album
Commentary}\label{tame-impala-2020-album-commentary}

The theme of the fourth Tame Impala album is evident before hearing a
note. It's in the song names, the album title, even the art: Kevin
Parker has time on his mind. Ruminating on memories, nostalgia,
uncertainty about the future, and the nature of time itself lies at the
heart of \emph{The Slow Rush}. Likewise, the music itself is both a
reflection on the sonic evolution of Parker's project as it's reached
festival headliner status---from warbly psychedelia to hypnotic
electronic thumps---and a forward thrust towards something new and
deeply fascinating.

On ``Posthumous Forgiveness,'' Parker addresses his relationship with
his father over a woozy, bluesy bass and dramatic synths, which later
give way to a far brighter, gentle sound. From the heavy horns on
``Instant Destiny'' and acoustic guitars on ``Tomorrow's Dust'' to the
choppy synths and deep funk of ``One More Year'' and ``Breathe Deeper,''
the album sounds as ambitious as its concept. There's a lot to think
about---and Kevin Parker has plenty to say about it. Here, written
exclusively for Apple Music, the Australian artist has provided
statements to accompany each track on \emph{The Slow Rush}.

``I just realized we were standing right here exactly one year ago,
doing the exact same thing. We're blissfully trapped. Our life is crazy
but where is it going? We won't be young forever but we sure do live
like it. Our book needs more chapters. Our time here is short, let's
make it count. I have a plan.''

``In love and feeling fearless. Let's be reckless with our futures. The
only thing special about the past is that it got us to where we are now.
Free from feeling sentimental\ldots we don't owe our possessions
anything. Let's do something that can't be undone just 'cause we can.
The future is our oyster.''

``Wrestling with demons of the past. Something from a long time ago

``A song for the eternal optimist. The pain of holding on to your
dreams. Anyone would say it's impossible from this point. True it will
take a miracle, but miracles happen all the time. I'm veering all over
the road and occasionally spinning out of control, but strictly speaking
I'm still on track.''

``A message from your negative thoughts: `Give up now\ldots{} It's

``The time has come. Nothing left to prepare. Nothing left to worry
about. Nothing left to do but sit and observe the stillness of
everything as time races faster than ever. Even shadows cast by the sun
appear to move. My future comes to me in flashes, but it no longer
scares me. As long as I remember what I value the most.''
